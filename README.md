# Catch Quest! 🎮🔥

**Catch Quest!** is an engaging, simple, and fun web-based game where players catch falling objects with a basket. The goal is to catch as many objects as possible, earn points, and avoid letting any objects fall past the basket. The game uses the power of the **Canvas API** for smooth, dynamic rendering and animations.

## 🕹️ **Game Concept**
In **Catch Quest!**, players control a basket that moves horizontally across the bottom of the screen, catching falling objects. Each object caught adds to the score, while missing an object brings the game closer to an end. Players aim to catch as many objects as possible before the game ends!

**Objective**: Catch falling objects, earn points, and avoid letting them fall past the basket. Save your score at the end and compete on the leaderboard.
